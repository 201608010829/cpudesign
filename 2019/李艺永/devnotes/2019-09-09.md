## The PC register

Since we're toying with a design of a single-cycle processor, the PC register should update its value once per cycle.

According to the spec and my interpretation, all conditional jumps and JAL employ PC-relative addressing, while JALR employ absolute-addressing. For the PC-relative addressing, we'll simply need an offset as an input, and add it to the current value. For JALR ins, we'll simply set the input offset as the target value.

Thus the core logic should be pretty simple:

```vhd
update: process(clk)
begin
    if (rising_edge(clk)) then
        if (mode = NORMAL) then
            addr <= addr_next;  -- Assume we've calculated this value during previous cycle.
        elsif (mode = RELATIVE) then
            addr <= std_logic_vector(signed(addr_next) + signed(offset));
        elsif (mode = ABSOLUTE) then
            addr(31 downto 1) <= offset(31 downto 1);
            addr(0) <= '0';
        end if;
    end if;
end
```

## Memory

Memory is byte-addressable, which can be described as

```vhdl
-- Array of bytes
type mem_type is array ((mem_size - 1 donwto 0)) of std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);
signal mem : mem_type;
```

I'm currently using a really simple design that doesn't involve clock or gate.
