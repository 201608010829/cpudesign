## Tedious little bug

Today is the deadline of the project. It really took me a great deal of time to figure out why RAM accesses keep getting out-of-bound runtime check. Because after I wrote testbenches for separate components, they all seemed to function correctly.

It suddenly clicked when I realized the PC value is getting overdoesed. In normal mode, the PC register points to next instruction(+4 bytes) upon every single rising edge of the supplied clock, and it never backs down. This is why RAM accesses are out-of-bound.

Since I'm running out of time, the ad-hoc fix is to check the address before accessing. See the if guard below:

```vhdl
-- Asynchronously read ir.
load_ir: process(i_addr)
    variable i: integer;
begin
    i := to_integer(unsigned(i_addr));
    if (i <= 4095 and i >= 0) then
        q_ir <= memdata(i + 3) & memdata(i + 2) & memdata(i + 1) & memdata(i);
    end if;
end process load_ir;
```
