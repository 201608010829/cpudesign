## Control Unit

I previously wrote an entity named ir_decoder, which is a bit more software-oriented design. Now I think it'd be more suitable to rename it as `control_unit` based on its functionalities:

- Obtain data/instruction from memory(not really implemented yet, we've been using a simple mem design).
- Decode instruction and transform it into control signals.
