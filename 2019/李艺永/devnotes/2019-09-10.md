## Control Unit

I previously wrote an entity named ir_decoder, which is a bit more software-oriented design. Now I think it'd be more suitable to rename it as `control_unit` based on its functionalities:

- Obtain data/instruction from memory(not really implemented yet, we've been using a simple mem design).
- Decode instruction and transform it into control signals.

I've now finished designing the control_unit entity. An explanation of this interface is as below:

```vhdl
entity control_unit is
    port (
        -- Input.
        ir : in std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);      -- Instruction Representation. 
        pc : in std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);      -- Current PC value. Used in AUIPC instruction.

        br_flag : in boolean;                       -- A flag emitted by ALU. Used for conditional branch.

        -- Output.

        res_sel : out std_logic_vector(1 downto 0); -- Result selector for rd. Selecting results among ALU(ALU_res), value read from RAM(RAM_res) and PC register(PC_res).
        alu_op : out alu_op_t;                      -- Decoded ALU operation or used in address calculation.
        pc_off : out std_logic_vector(31 downto 0); -- Offset to add to PC register. This is wired to PC component.
        pc_mode : out std_logic_vector(1 downto 0); -- normal(+4), relative and absolute.

        rs1 : out std_logic_vector(4 downto 0);     -- src operand idx wired to ALU.
        rs2 : out std_logic_vector(4 downto 0);     -- src operand idx wired to a multiplexr.
        en_write_reg : out boolean;                 -- A flag that indicates whether to write result of ALU to register rd.
        rd : out std_logic_vector(4 downto 0);

        en_imm : out std_logic_vector(0 downto 0);  -- A flag that indicates whether [imm] is valid. Used in multiplexing between rs2 and imm.
        imm : out std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);    -- The actual immediate value(sign-extended).

        en_write_ram : out boolean;                 -- A flag that indicates whether the result of ALU should be rewritten to memory.
    );
end control_unit;
```

The architecture of this control_unit is pretty straight forward once we've classified instructions according to those various encodings and opcodes:

- For Arithmetic and logical operations, instructions are encoded as of either I-type(which there's an immediate involved) or R-type(which both operands are supplied from regs, if it takes two):
    - The actual work is delegated to ALU entity, which is designed to be fairly simple.
    - The final operation of ALU is determined by a combination of opcodes, funct3 field(optional) and funct7(optional).
    - The res_sel will be set to `ALU_res`, indicating the result of ALU should be written to register rd.

- For Load and Store operations, instructions are encoded as of I-type and S-type, repectively.
    - Both Load and Store take advantage of ALU to calculate target address of RAM.
    - Load actually writes to rd. Thus `res_sel` should be set to `RAM_res`, which indicates the result of a read from RAM is selected.
    - Store actually writes to RAM, not rd. Thus the value of `res_sel` does not make any difference.

- For JAL and JALR:
    - Both instruction set `res_sel` to `PC_res`, which can be obtained from PC component.
    - JAL uses PC-relative jump. The offset is wired directly to PC from control_unit.
    - JALR uses PC-absolute jump. The target address is obtained from ALU result.

- For U-type encoding:
    - Both of them set `res_sel` to `ALU_res`.
    - LUI simply writes the immediate to `rd`. This requires rs1 to set to 0.
    - For AUIPC, The ALU adds current PC value to the immediate, and adds the result to `rd`.

One piece of missing important design is RAM controller, which takes care of variant Load & Store instructions decoding and interpretation. This component should be connected between actual RAM and the control unit.
