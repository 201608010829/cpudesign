## Current status

- Have scanned through Chapter 1 and 2, RISCV-SPEC roughly about two days ago. Have seen the big picture.
- Have learned some basics about VHDL from a brief [website](http://vhdl.renerta.com/mobile/index.html).
- [riscv-rv32i](https://github.com/jens-na/riscv-rv32i) is a good reference.

## TODOs

- Maybe find an open source VHDL simulator?
- Start actually writing VHDL.
